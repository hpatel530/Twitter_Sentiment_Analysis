    "In one day, there are over 500 million tweets among all twitter users. That's 6,000 tweets every second. You can assume they are either positive, negative or neutral. They could be about a person, place, or thing. In this case, it will be about products. Apple has over 13 million twitter followers and Google has over 22 million twitter followers. The goal of this project is to build a Natural Processing Language model to analyze twitter sentiments about Apple and Google products as either positive, negative or neutral. The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world and it contains over 9,000 tweets that include all words that are related to the Apple or Google brand. \n",
